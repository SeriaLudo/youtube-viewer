 Embed youtube in browser for better android split-screen viewing.

# Why?
I like to have youtube playing while browsing in a different browser on android split-screen. Often it's just the audio I'm interested in - I'm consuming information, not entertainment. Recent changes to the youtube mobile site stop playing if I reduce size beyond a certain height. If I copy and paste the url into this site, I get around that irritating behavoir, and have more screen space for other functions.

This also lets you, on android, switch to another tab in full screen, press play, and listen to the audio while using another app in full screen. 

Also allows you to block ads.
